# Maximo Work Orders

Help the user query, analyze, or build pipelines on IBM Maximo work-order data. This skill adds the work-order-specific schema, gold-standard queries, reusable views, and Trusted UDFs on top of `maximo-overview`'s baseline data-model literacy and universal gotchas.

> **FIRST:** load the `maximo-overview` skill — it carries the baseline Maximo data model, the module map, and the universal gotchas. This skill builds on that foundation.

## When to use

Triggered by work-order operational questions:
- "What's our open WO backlog?"
- "Show me WOs aging over 90 days"
- "Labor hours by craft last month"
- "How many corrective vs preventive WOs did we complete?"
- "Status history for WO X"
- "Top assets by WO volume"
- "Actual vs planned labor on completed WOs"
- "Build a work-order-optimization dashboard"

**Defer to siblings when:**
- Reliability metrics (MTBF, MTTR, PM compliance) → `maximo-reliability`
- Forward-looking PM planning (forecasts, JOBPLAN content management) → `maximo-pm-planning`
- Integrity / inspection workflows → `maximo-integrity`

## Top gotchas

These traps silently produce wrong numbers. Read before writing any non-trivial query (full set of 15 in [gotchas.md](gotchas.md); `maximo-overview` carries the universal ones, including `WORKORDER.STATUS`-current-vs-`WOSTATUS`-history):

1. **`WHERE WOCLASS = 'WORKORDER'`.** The `WORKORDER` table also holds `PM`, `CHANGE`, `RELEASE`, `ACTIVITY` records. Almost every WO query must filter to `'WORKORDER'`, or backlog/labor/aging numbers inflate.
2. **`ISTASK = 0` to drop tasks — but mind child WOs.** `ISTASK = 1` rows are tasks *within* a parent (not standalone WOs); `ISTASK = 0` with a `PARENT` set is a *child work order* (independently tracked). Count `ISTASK = 0` for WO counts; for top-level headers only, add `PARENT IS NULL`. `PARENT` is mutable (work packages regroup WOs).
3. **`SITEID` in every join.** `WONUM`, `ASSETNUM`, `LOCATION` are unique only within a site. Multi-site customers reuse the same `WONUM` at different sites — joining without `SITEID` produces a cross product.
4. **`STATUS` is a synonym domain, and `HISTORYFLAG` hides closed work.** `WORKORDER.STATUS` stores the customer-renamable synonym (`VALUE`), not the internal `MAXVALUE` — so a literal `STATUS IN ('COMP',…)` silently misses custom synonyms. Resolve via `SYNONYMDOMAIN` (gotcha 5). Separately, closed/cancelled WOs get `HISTORYFLAG = 1` and standard Maximo views filter `HISTORYFLAG = 0` — confirm closed work is even present before computing completion/trend metrics.
5. **`COMP` ≠ `CLOSE` for "completed work."** `COMP` = physical work done; `CLOSE` = a separate, often-deferred finalization (many shops never CLOSE). Key "completed" on `COMP`-or-later, not `CLOSE`. (`WPLABOR`/`WPMATERIAL` = PLANNED vs `LABTRANS` = ACTUAL, and the rest, are in [gotchas.md](gotchas.md).)

## Questions to surface first

Surface these to the user *before* answering — there is no defensible default:

1. **Open-status set.** "Open" is customer-configurable. Maximo defaults usually mean *every status except* `COMP`, `CLOSE`, `CAN` — but each customer may extend `WOSTATUS` synonyms differently. Default: `('WAPPR','APPR','INPRG','WSCH','WMATL')`. Confirm or override. The canonical lookup is `SYNONYMDOMAIN` filtered to `DOMAINID = 'WOSTATUS'` — and because `STATUS` stores the *synonym* (`VALUE`), resolve the set from the internal `MAXVALUE` rather than hard-coding literals (gotcha 5).
2. **"Completed" definition.** Does the user mean `COMP` (physical work done) or only `CLOSE` (finalized)? Default to `COMP`-or-later, since closing is frequently deferred. Also confirm closed WOs are present in the data at all — some pipelines mirror Maximo's `HISTORYFLAG = 0` filter and silently drop them (gotcha 11).
3. **Backlog age date column.** "Days aged" can mean `current_date() - REPORTDATE` (created) or `current_date() - STATUSDATE` (days in current status). These produce different numbers. Confirm which the user wants.
4. **`WORKTYPE` codes.** Defaults (`CM`, `PM`, `EM`, `PROJ`) are advisory — many customers add 10+ work types or use different codes entirely. If a question depends on the corrective-vs-preventive split, confirm the codes that exist in this deployment. Note: work type is *not* a clean reactive-vs-proactive proxy (gotcha 14) — for that ratio, defer to `maximo-reliability`.

## Pre-flight (per session)

One-time session config — cache, don't re-ask:

1. **Catalog/schema** — confirm via the customer's workspace glossary skill if installed, or ask.
2. **Glossary skill** — is a `<customer>-maximo-glossary` workspace skill installed? Prefer it for business-term resolution.

If a business term is ambiguous and no glossary covers it, **ask before guessing**.

## Workflow

**Building a semantic layer / Genie Agent / dashboard (the most common ask):** start from
[metric_view.yaml](metric_view.yaml) — the governed WO semantic layer. Its measures (`open_wo_count`,
`mean_time_to_complete`, `avg_backlog_age_days`, `pct_open`, …) and **agent metadata** (synonyms like
"WO backlog", "MTTC", "aging") are defined once and sliceable by site / status / work type / criticality.
Defer creation & registration mechanics to the platform skill [`databricks-metric-views`](https://github.com/databricks-solutions/ai-dev-kit/tree/main/databricks-skills/databricks-metric-views); `maximo-setup` owns registration.

**Answering an ad-hoc question:** resolve in this order:

1. **Metric view** — if `wo_metrics` is registered, query it with `MEASURE(...)`; it encodes the canonical definitions (and the woclass/istask filter).
2. **Trusted UDFs** in [metric_udfs.sql](metric_udfs.sql) — `open_wo_count`, `wo_aging_bucket`, `mean_time_to_complete`, `backlog_age_days`, `time_in_current_status` — when the metric takes parameters.
3. **Parameterized example query** — check [examples.sql](examples.sql) for an existing pattern; use it with the user's parameters.
4. **Pre-joined view** — compose using `v_workorder_enriched` / `v_workorder_status_history` / `v_labor_actuals` from [views.sql](views.sql).
5. **Raw tables** — only when the view layer doesn't cover the join shape. Explain why you're skipping the views.

## What's in this skill

- [schema.md](schema.md) — load when joining or selecting columns. Full reference for `WORKORDER`, `WOSTATUS`, `ASSET`, `LOCATIONS`, `LABTRANS`, `WPLABOR`/`WPMATERIAL`, `JOBPLAN`, `FAILUREREPORT`.
- [gotchas.md](gotchas.md) — load before writing non-trivial joins. 15 gotchas: the inline 5 plus status-synonym resolution, `HISTORYFLAG`/`COMP`-vs-`CLOSE`/`HISTEDIT`, follow-up (originator) hierarchies, app-server-timezone date storage, corrective≠reactive, per-record cost columns, REST-API ingestion gap, date semantics, failure-code hierarchy, custom worktypes.
- [examples.sql](examples.sql) — load when the user's question matches a pattern (backlog by site, aging buckets, MTTC, actual vs planned, status history, craft utilization, failure pareto).
- [views.sql](views.sql) — DDL for `v_workorder_enriched`, `v_workorder_status_history`, `v_labor_actuals`. Register once via `maximo-setup`.
- [metric_udfs.sql](metric_udfs.sql) — Trusted Asset UC SQL functions Genie Code calls as governed metrics instead of regenerating ad-hoc SQL. Register once via `maximo-setup`.
- [metric_view.yaml](metric_view.yaml) — **load when** building/extending the WO semantic layer, a Genie Agent, or a dashboard. The metric view: canonical measures + **agent metadata** (synonyms/display_name/format) over `v_workorder_enriched`, with the woclass/istask filter baked in. Register once via `maximo-setup`; mechanics live in the platform skill `databricks-metric-views`.

## What NOT to do

- Don't write reliability metrics (MTBF / MTTR / PM compliance) — that's `maximo-reliability`'s job.
- Don't ignore the universal gotchas from `maximo-overview` (composite-key joins, status history, ISTASK dedup, WOCLASS filter).
- Don't hard-code the open-status set — surface the question to the user (see *Questions to surface first*) or read from the workspace glossary.
- Don't fabricate columns not in [schema.md](schema.md). If the user mentions a custom column, check the workspace glossary or ask.
- Don't write or alter UC comments / table metadata from this skill — UC comments are owned by `maximo-setup` (preview-then-apply, gated on explicit user approval). Defer to it.

## Composes with

- **`maximo-labor-resources`** for labor master detail (`LABOR`, `PERSON`, qualifications, crews). This skill uses `LABTRANS.LABORCODE` as a foreign key but doesn't document the labor master itself.
- **`maximo-asset-hierarchy`** for hierarchical rollups ("open WOs under station X", "backlog by region"). Use `v_location_rollup_keys` to roll up WO counts/cost to any location parent.
- **`maximo-maintenance-cost`** for any cost question beyond a single-record readout — cost rollup, estimate-vs-actual variance, contractor spend, PM-vs-CM cost, and multi-currency (`WOCURRENCY`) normalization. This skill's views pass `ACTLABCOST`/`ACTMATCOST` through but don't own cost methodology (gotcha 15).
- **`maximo-reliability`** for reliability KPIs computed *from* WO data — MTBF, MTTR, PM compliance, and reactive-vs-proactive / schedule-compliance ratios (which must be measured on labor hours, not WO counts — gotcha 14).
- **`maximo-setup`** to register the views in [views.sql](views.sql), the Trusted UDFs in [metric_udfs.sql](metric_udfs.sql), and the metric view in [metric_view.yaml](metric_view.yaml). Never run those scripts from this skill — defer to setup's preview-then-apply workflow.
- **`databricks-metric-views`** (platform) — the *mechanics* of creating/registering/refreshing the WO metric view. This skill supplies the source-specific YAML + agent metadata; that skill supplies the how.
